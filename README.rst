A project for workload development to meet the OpenStack Interop Challenge

With the success of the Interop Challenge in Barcelona, the Interop Challenge
mission continues to gain momentum. We will use this project and repository
where we can focus on creating and iterating on new OpenStack workloads that
will be used to demonstrate that OpenStack clouds are interoperable across a
variety of application domains including enterprise workloads, NFV workloads,
K8s, and many others under evaluation. We will also use this repo to store
our best practices documents and other collateral that facilitates improving
the state of OpenStack Clouds' ability to interoperate.
